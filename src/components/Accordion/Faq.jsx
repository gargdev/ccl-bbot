    question: "3.	What should I not expect from our Mentors?",
    answer:
      "●	In depth code analysis, developing new features or spending extensive time on debugging. They act as coaches and guides not freelancers. ●	Not a personalized training program. Mentors focus on helping rather than delivering lectures readily available online but they can direct you to appropriate resources. ●	24/7 support. Mentors dedicate their free time to supporting you but they may have busy schedules and cannot always respond immediately. ●	Instant replies. Or mentorship s are designed for the long term, often exceeding 30 days. If your mentor does not respond for a few hours, there is no need to panic however, ensure you still feel prioritised and reach out if you feel neglected",
