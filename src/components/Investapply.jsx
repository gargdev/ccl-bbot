                Your profile should include information about the startup, such
                as its industry, stage of development, funding needs, and team
                members. The more complete the profile, the better chance the
                startup will have of being matched with investors who are

                If the investor meetings go well, the startup may receive
                funding. CCL also provides additional resources, such as
                mentorship, networking opportunities, and educational content,
                to help the startup grow.
